# microDBiT: Spatial Microbiome Sequencing

![microDBiT overview](images/microDBiT.png)  

**microDBiT** is a microfluidic-based spatial transcriptomics platform that enables simultaneous, high-resolution profiling of host and microbial RNAs—including both mRNA and rRNA—within the same tissue section.

Unlike conventional spatial transcriptomics methods that focus exclusively on eukaryotic transcripts, microDBiT integrates:
- Optimized microfluidic barcoding chemistry
- Tissue handling protocols designed to preserve microbial RNAs  
- Compatibility with small and low-abundance bacterial populations

This technology opens new avenues for studying host-microbiome interactions at spatial resolution across complex tissues.
